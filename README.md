# Into The Forrest

### What is this?
A free, simple tool to help searchers of Forrest Fenn's treasure. Each layer you can toggle was created with a pile of scripts based on various things that Forrest has said from USGS provided GIS files. I'm working on making this reproducable in the future to make the information as accessible and tweakable as possible, but this site is the easiest way to currenty use the work I've done.

### Why build it?
After learning about the treasure from a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16941593) post some months ago, I started playing with deciphering the Poem. I quickly realized that it was hard to cross reference what you're seeing on Google Maps and hints that Fenn has given. I decided it'd be a fun little project to dive into GIS, so the project was born.

### How do you use this?
I tried to make it as easy as possible to use. The layer selector on the left has popup information about each layer. Let me know if any of them don't make sense to you. I tried to make them as self-explanitory as possible.

You can zoom, tilt, and twist to your heart's content to see if your solve falls inside the parameters I tried to make.

### What about privacy?
I know some people are concerned about revealing their solves before they get a chance to search for them. Just to be clear, I don't log any searches made, pins placed, or anything else. I do use Google Analytics to see how much traffic the site gets, but I'm not going to be upset if you block it. I will never serve ads.

### Who built this?
My name is Joe Ipson. I don't do much social media, but you can find me on [Github](https://github.com/m0ngr31). I currently work as a Software Engineer for [Verizon Media (Yahoo!)](https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/). You can contact me at joe[at]ipson.me.

### What's next?
This is really just the beginning. Here's what I'm planning next:

- Feed it more data to narrow down the possibilities. I'm happy to receive suggestions or new data from anybody willing to help.
- Make it mobile friendly.
- You tell me!

### How can I help?
Since this is just a hobby project, I'm not looking to make any money on this. But if it does help you find the treasure, I wouldn't cry if you gave me a coin :). However, it does cost me money to run the server and access the Google Maps/Mapbox APIs. You can Buy me a Coffee if you find it helpful.

If you have ideas for new layers or feedback on current one, I'd love to hear from you.
